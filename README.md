# Hi, I'm Shafaq 👋

I'm an early-career data analyst and former educator who loves turning data into clear, actionable stories. I work with real datasets to find revenue patterns, forecast trends, and build visual reports that are easy to understand and share.

- Projects: Northwind revenue insights, Sakila revenue-growth analysis

## Projects
- Northwind — revenue-related insights and forecasting using Excel & SQL  
- Sakila — revenue growth exploration across channels and time using SQL & Power BI

## What I do
- Clean, transform, and model data to make it meaningful
- Use PivotTables, charts and dashboards to surface trends and anomalies
- Write SQL to extract business-ready tables and find the story behind the numbers
- Build Power BI dashboards to present insights in simple, interactive ways
- Apply basic forecasting to identify future revenue patterns

## How to explore my work
1. Open each project repository and read that repo's README for goals and findings.
2. Look for SQL scripts, Excel files (or exported CSVs), and Power BI reports (.pbix).
3. Run the included notebooks or follow the reproduction steps in each repo to recreate the analysis.

## Skills & tools
